# C-Language-Tutorial
This repository contains basic C programs I wrote while learning the fundamentals of programming. These exercises helped me develop logical thinking, strengthen analytical skills, and build a strong programming foundation.
C language is widely taught in the early semesters of engineering, and I hope these examples serve as a helpful resource for others on the same path.
ðŸ’¡ Whether you're a student revising your basics or a beginner exploring C programming for the first time, this repo might just help you get started.
