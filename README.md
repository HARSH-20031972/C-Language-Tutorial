📘 C Language Tutorial
This repository contains a collection of basic C programs that I wrote while learning the fundamentals of programming. These exercises helped me develop logical thinking, analytical problem-solving, and a strong foundation in coding.

C is one of the first languages introduced in engineering and computer science courses. I’ve included not only essential practice problems but also the solutions to assignments from the “Code With Harry” C language course, which many beginners find helpful.

🚀 What You'll Find Here:
Simple and well-commented C programs
Solutions to beginner-level assignments
Practical examples to understand core concepts like loops, functions, arrays, pointers, and more

👨‍💻 Who This Is For:
Engineering students revising their basics
Beginners exploring C programming
Anyone looking for clear and concise C examples for practice
Feel free to fork this repository, use it as a reference, or contribute improvements.
Happy coding! 😊
